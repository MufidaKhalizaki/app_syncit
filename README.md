#App SyncIt
The inital implementation of a music share and sync application for Android using WiFi-Direct. 

## What it does
It was created to play a audio track on two Android devices. The application connects via WiFi-Direct and sends a selected audio file to the client device. Then it measures the RTT delay between the two devices and tries to play the track simultaneously on both devices. 

## Project status
Due to the buggy Wifi-Direct api in Android, it was put on hold. Hoping to pick it up again in the near future.
